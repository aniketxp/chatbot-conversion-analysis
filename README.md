# 📊 Chatbot Conversion Rate Optimization  

## 📌 Overview  
This project evaluates whether an AI chatbot improves conversion rates using **Chi-square testing** and **Bayesian A/B testing**. It includes:  
✅ **Power analysis** to determine sample size  
✅ **Dummy data generation** for simulation  
✅ **Statistical hypothesis testing**  
✅ **Bayesian inference** for probability estimation  
✅ **Visualization** to compare conversion rates  

## 📌 Hypothesis  
- **Null Hypothesis (H₀):** The conversion rate is the same for both groups.  
- **Alternative Hypothesis (H₁):** Users who interact with the chatbot have a higher conversion rate than those who don’t.  

## 📌 Installation  
Clone the repository and install dependencies:  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/chatbot-conversion-test.git
cd chatbot-conversion-test
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 📌 How to Run  
Run the Python script:  
```bash
python chatbot_conversion_test.py
```
Or open the Jupyter Notebook:  
```bash
jupyter notebook chatbot_conversion_test.ipynb
```

## 📌 Files  
- **chatbot_conversion_test.py** – Main script with power analysis, hypothesis testing, and visualization.  
- **chatbot_conversion_test.ipynb** – Jupyter Notebook version with step-by-step explanations.  
- **requirements.txt** – List of required Python libraries.  
- **README.md** – This documentation.  

## 📌 Results & Interpretation  
- If **p-value < 0.05**, chatbot has a **significant impact** on conversion rates.  
- If **p-value ≥ 0.05**, chatbot **does not significantly** impact conversions.  
- Bayesian inference provides a probability estimate for chatbot effectiveness.  

## 📌 Key Takeaways  
✅ **Test different chatbot prompts** to optimize engagement.  
✅ **Analyze user segments** (new vs. returning) for deeper insights.  
✅ **Measure secondary effects** (time on site, retention, engagement).
